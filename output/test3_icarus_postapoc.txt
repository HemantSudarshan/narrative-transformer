====================================================

A transformation of the classic tale into a Post-Apocalyptic setting.


## Opening Image
The wind howled through the skeletal remains of towering skyscrapers, carrying with it the acrid scent of decay and rust. Scorch trudged through the rubble-strewn streets of what once was a bustling metropolis, now reduced to a graveyard of twisted metal and shattered glass. The remnants of a long-gone civilization loomed over him, a stark reminder of the world that had been lost.

Rivet, his grizzled mentor, moved ahead with a purpose, his eyes scanning the debris for any sign of salvageable technology. His hands expertly sifted through the wreckage, his fingers tracing the contours of a broken device, a faint glimmer of hope in his weathered face.

"Keep your wits about you, Scorch," Rivet muttered, his voice rough with years of hardship. "This place holds secrets we can only dream of."

Scorch nodded, his gaze drawn to a twisted hulk of metal that once might have been a vehicle. He reached out tentatively, brushing aside layers of grime to reveal a faint glint of pre-apocalypse tech. His heart quickened with a mix of excitement and trepidation as he realized the potential value of his find.

As they continued their search, the echoes of the past whispered through the ruins, a haunting reminder of what once was. The shattered remnants of a society long gone bore witness to their struggle for survival in a world that cared not for sentimentality.

## Debate
The sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the desolate wasteland. Scorch trudged through the rubble-strewn streets, his eyes scanning for any glint of valuable pre-apocalypse tech. Rivet, his mentor, followed close behind, a makeshift tool in hand ready for scavenging.

As they rounded a corner, a metallic clang echoed through the ruins. Scorch froze, hand hovering over the hilt of his makeshift blade. Rivet placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder, a silent signal to proceed with caution.

A figure emerged from the shadows, clad in tattered garments and a mask fashioned from old circuit boards. It was Despot, the cruel ruler of the nearby settlement known for his ruthless tactics in acquiring resources. His gaze bore into Scorch, a silent threat hanging in the air.

"Scorch, Rivet," Despot's voice grated like sandpaper. "I see you've been busy searching for treasures in my domain."

Scorch clenched his jaw, weighing his options. He knew Despot wouldn't hesitate to turn hostile if provoked. Rivet stepped forward, a calm demeanor masking his unease.

"We mean no harm, Despot," Rivet's voice was steady. "We're just trying to survive like everyone else."

Despot's masked face betrayed no emotion as he studied them. The tension in the air was palpable, a precarious balance hanging between cooperation and conflict.

After a tense moment, Despot finally spoke, his voice low and cold. "Survival comes at a price, Rivet. You know this."

With a dismissive wave of his hand, Despot turned and disappeared back into the shadows, leaving Scorch and Rivet standing alone amidst the ruins.

As the echoes of Despot's footsteps faded, Scorch let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding. Rivet clapped a reassuring hand on his shoulder, their silent communication speaking volumes.

In the fading light, they resumed their search, the weight of their encounter with Despot lingering in the air like a storm on the horizon.

## Break into Two
The sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked asphalt of the abandoned highway, the heat shimmering in waves that distorted the horizon. Scorch wiped the sweat from his brow, his eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of life. Beside him, Rivet adjusted the straps on his makeshift backpack, a glint of determination in his eyes.

"We're getting close, Scorch," Rivet's voice was grizzled but filled with a quiet resolve. "The cache should be just beyond those hills."

Scorch nodded, his grip tightening on the handle of his scavenged rifle. The journey had been long and treacherous, through desolate wastelands and crumbling ruins. But the promise of valuable pre-apocalypse tech drove him forward, fueled by a desperate hope for a better future.

As they crested the final ridge, a sprawling valley spread out before them, dotted with the remnants of rusted machinery and shattered buildings. In the distance, a glimmer of light caught Scorch's eye, drawing him further into the heart of the wasteland.

"We need to be cautious," Rivet warned, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of danger. "Despot's forces are known to patrol these parts. We can't afford to get caught."

Scorch nodded, his jaw set in determination as they picked their way through the debris-strewn landscape. Every step brought them closer to their goal, but also closer to the lurking threats that roamed the wastelands.

Suddenly, a harsh voice cut through the silence, echoing off the shattered walls of a crumbling building. "Well, well, what do we have here?" Despot's sneer was unmistakable as he stepped out from the shadows, his followers emerging from the ruins like specters.

Scorch felt a surge of adrenaline as he raised his rifle, Rivet standing beside him, unwavering. This was the moment of truth, the point of no return. With the cache within their reach, they had a choice to make – retreat and live to fight another day, or stand their ground and face the consequences.

As the tension crackled in the air, Scorch locked eyes with Rivet, a silent understanding passing between them. They were committed to the journey, no matter the cost.

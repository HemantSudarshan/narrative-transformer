THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE

A boastful Hare constantly mocked a slow-moving Tortoise for his pace. "You're so slow!" the Hare would laugh. "I could run circles around you!"

One day, tired of the mockery, the Tortoise challenged the Hare to a race. The Hare accepted immediately, confident of an easy victory. All the forest animals gathered to watch.

The race began. The Hare sprinted ahead at incredible speed, leaving the Tortoise far behind. Seeing how far ahead he was, the Hare decided to take a nap under a tree. "I have plenty of time," he thought. "The Tortoise will never catch up."

Meanwhile, the Tortoise kept moving at his steady, slow pace. He never stopped, never got distracted, just kept putting one foot in front of the other.

When the Hare finally woke from his nap, he was shocked to see the Tortoise near the finish line. The Hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The Tortoise crossed the finish line first, winning the race.

The forest animals cheered for the Tortoise. The Hare learned that overconfidence and laziness lead to failure, while persistence and determination bring success.

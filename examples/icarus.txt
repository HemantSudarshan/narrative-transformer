THE FLIGHT OF ICARUS

Daedalus was a brilliant inventor trapped on the island of Crete with his son Icarus. King Minos had imprisoned them in a tall tower for helping kill the Minotaur. No ship could escape the king's watchful navy.

Determined to escape, Daedalus conceived a daring plan. He collected feathers from birds and fastened them together with wax and thread, creating two pairs of magnificent wings. He taught Icarus how to use them.

Before their escape, Daedalus gave his son crucial warnings: "Fly a middle course. If you fly too low, the sea spray will soak the feathers. If you fly too high, the sun's heat will melt the wax. Stay close to me and you'll be safe."

They took flight, escaping the tower. The sensation of flying filled Icarus with exhilaration. Peasants below looked up in wonder, thinking they were gods. Daedalus stayed cautious, maintaining a steady altitude.

But Icarus, drunk on the thrill of flight, grew bold and reckless. Ignoring his father's warnings, he soared higher and higher, wanting to touch the heavens. The sun grew hotter.

Daedalus called out in warning, but Icarus didn't listen. The wax began to melt. Feathers came loose. Suddenly, the wings fell apart. Icarus plummeted from the sky, crashing into the sea and drowning.

Daedalus wept for his lost son, cursing his own invention. He buried Icarus on a nearby island and flew on alone, forever haunted by the price of hubris.

CINDERELLA

A kind-hearted young woman named Cinderella lives with her cruel stepmother and two vain stepsisters. After her father's death, they force her to be their servant, making her cook, clean, and sleep by the fireplace covered in cinders.

The royal palace announces a grand ball where the prince will choose a bride. Cinderella's stepsisters prepare excitedly, but Cinderella is forbidden from attending and has no suitable clothes.

As Cinderella weeps in the garden, her Fairy Godmother appears. Using magic, she transforms a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, and Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown with glass slippers. But the magic will end at midnight.

At the ball, the prince is captivated by Cinderella's beauty and grace. They dance all evening, falling in love. When the clock strikes midnight, Cinderella flees, losing one glass slipper on the palace steps.

The prince searches the kingdom, trying the slipper on every maiden. When he reaches Cinderella's house, the stepsisters try to force their feet into the slipper, but it doesn't fit. Cinderella asks to try, and the slipper fits perfectly.

The prince recognizes her as his true love. They marry and live happily ever after, with Cinderella forgiving her stepfamily.

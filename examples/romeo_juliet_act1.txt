ROMEO AND JULIET - Act 1 & 2 Summary

[PROLOGUE]
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.

[ACT 1, SCENE 1 - A public place in Verona]
Servants of the Capulet and Montague households brawl in the streets of Verona. 
The violence escalates until Prince Escalus arrives and threatens death to anyone 
who disturbs the peace again. The ancient feud between the two noble families 
has torn the city apart.

[ACT 1, SCENE 2 - Capulet's house]
Count Paris asks Lord Capulet for permission to marry his daughter Juliet, who 
is not yet fourteen. Capulet suggests Paris wait two more years, but invites 
him to a feast that evening where he might win Juliet's affection. Romeo and 
his friend Benvolio learn of the feast and decide to attend, despite being 
Montagues. Romeo is lovesick over Rosaline, who has rejected him.

[ACT 1, SCENE 5 - Capulet's feast]
Romeo and his friends sneak into the Capulet feast wearing masks. Romeo sees 
Juliet for the first time and is instantly captivated, forgetting about 
Rosaline entirely. He approaches her and they share a conversation and a kiss. 
Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, recognizes Romeo as a Montague and wants to fight him, 
but Lord Capulet stops him to avoid disrupting the party.

After the feast, Romeo and Juliet each discover the other's true identity and 
are devastated to learn they belong to rival families.

[ACT 2, SCENE 1 - Outside Capulet's orchard]
Romeo hides from his friends and climbs the wall into the Capulet orchard, 
unable to leave without seeing Juliet again.

[ACT 2, SCENE 2 - The famous balcony scene]
Romeo stands in the orchard below Juliet's window. Juliet appears on her balcony, 
unaware Romeo is listening. She speaks aloud her feelings about Romeo, lamenting 
that he is a Montague: "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy 
father and refuse thy name."

Romeo reveals himself and they confess their love for each other. Despite knowing 
their families would forbid their relationship, they decide to marry in secret. 
Juliet promises to send a messenger to Romeo the next day to learn the wedding 
plans.

[ACT 2, SCENE 3 - Friar Laurence's cell]
Early in the morning, Romeo visits Friar Laurence and asks him to marry Romeo 
and Juliet that very day. The Friar is surprised by how quickly Romeo has 
forgotten Rosaline, but agrees to perform the ceremony, hoping it might end 
the feud between the families.

[ACT 2, SCENE 4 - A street in Verona]
Tybalt sends a challenge to Romeo to duel. Romeo's friends, Mercutio and 
Benvolio, discuss the challenge. Juliet's Nurse arrives with a message for 
Romeo. Romeo tells the Nurse to have Juliet come to Friar Laurence's cell 
that afternoon, where they will be married in secret.

[ACT 2, SCENE 5 - Capulet's house]
Juliet waits impatiently for the Nurse to return with Romeo's message. When 
the Nurse finally arrives, she teases Juliet before revealing the good news: 
Romeo will marry her that afternoon at Friar Laurence's cell.

[ACT 2, SCENE 6 - Friar Laurence's cell]
Romeo and Juliet meet at the Friar's cell and are married in a brief but 
joyful ceremony. The Friar warns them about loving too intensely, saying 
"These violent delights have violent ends." The young lovers, blissfully 
happy, do not heed his warning.
